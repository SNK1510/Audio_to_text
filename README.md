# Whisper Speech-to-Text Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use OpenAI's Whisper model to convert audio files (such as songs, podcasts, or speeches) into text using Python. The project leverages Whisper's powerful speech recognition capabilities, which are optimized for multiple languages and accents.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **openai-whisper**: OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text conversion.
- **ffmpeg**: Required for audio preprocessing.

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install openai-whisper ffmpeg pydub
```


## Input 
I got the audio from a free audiobook site online - https://librivox.org/. The input to my notebook is one of the tracks from the audiobook called 'The Adventures of a Nature Guide'

## Output 
*Paulne is all nature as a resting wheel by William Wordsworth, read for LibreVox.org by Anita Hibberd, February 17th, 2025. Paulne is all nature as a resting wheel. The kind are couched upon the dewy grass. The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass, is up and cropping yet his later meal. Arches the ground, a slumber seems to steal or veil and mountain and the starless sky. Now, in this blank of things, a harmony home-filled and home-created seems to heal that grief for which the senses still supply fresh food. For only then, when memory is hushed, am I at rest. My friends restrain those busy cares that would lay my pain. Oh, leave me to myself, nor let me feel the officious touch that makes me droop again. End of poem.
